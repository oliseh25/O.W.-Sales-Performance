# O.W.-Sales-Performance
The company's sales success, product profitability, geographical outcomes, and salesperson appraisal were the main topics of this project. This research finds critical information to help guide vital decisions by comparing key categories including revenue, salesperson contributions, geographies, and shipment data.

DATA CLEANING To ensure the correctness of the analysis, I used a range of data cleaning methods to ensure the dataset was accurate. To get rid of discrepancies in the dataset, I looked for duplicates. For clarity, I organised the dataset into distinct topics. I verified the figures, particularly the revenue component, for correct format. In order to facilitate maintenance and provide dynamic insights, I also formatted the dataset into a regular Excel table.
 During the reviewed year, the company's total revenue was $435,036.16. The best-performing product category was beverages, which brought in $110,577.11 in sales and 91 units sold. While areas like the Eastern region showed considerable promise, the Northern region led in revenue with $141,660.34. With respective contributions of $67,180.50 and $50,198.35, New York and Portland led Ship City sales. Due to Christmas holiday demand and summer holiday spending, seasonal statistics showed that December and July had the biggest sales periods. With a total of $110,577.11, beverages were likewise the product that brought in the most money for the business. Grains brought in the least amount of money, $2884.00. According to a trend, Company D consistently outperforms other clients in all areas, indicating potential for a solid rapport between the business and its clients.
